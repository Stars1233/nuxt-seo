## Nuxt SEO Utils

In moving to the stable release, Nuxt SEO experiments has been renamed from `nuxt-seo-experiments` to `nuxt-seo-utils`.

The original name of the module was `nuxt-seo-experiments`, hinting that the features weren't stable and that they would land in the Nuxt core. This is no longer the case, and the module has been renamed to reflect this.

With this rename the module scope changes to include the random functionality that Nuxt SEO was previously providing:

- `useBreadcrumbItems()` composable
- Config: `redirectToCanonicalSiteUrl`
- Config: `fallbackTitle`
- Config: `automaticDefaults`

As Nuxt SEO Utils shared the same config key as the Nuxt SEO module, no changes are required to your config, however, it's worth
testing your site to ensure that everything is working as expected.
