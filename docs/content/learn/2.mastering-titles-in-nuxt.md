## Introduction

I've been working with Nuxt for a while now, and I've learned that page titles are a big deal in SEO.
They're what users see first in search results, and they can really make a difference in whether someone clicks on your link or not.
From what I've seen, good titles help search engines understand your content better and can give your rankings a boost.
Most search engines seem to prefer titles under 60 characters, with the important stuff up front.

One thing I love about Nuxt is how it makes handling titles pretty straightforward.
Its built-in SEO tools and composables have saved me a ton of time.
Let me walk you through how I usually set things up.

## Setting Up Titles

In Nuxt, we use this thing called `useHead()` to manage meta info, including titles. Here's a basic example:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  title: 'Home'
})
</script>
```

I usually put this in the `<script setup>` block of my page components. Oh, and if your titles depend on dynamic data, make sure they update properly as your component changes. I once spent hours debugging because I forgot about this!

### Handling Async Data / Refs

If you're fetching data asynchronously, you'll want to make sure your title updates when the data loads. Here's how I usually do it:

Here's something that tripped me up at first: handling titles that depend on async data. Like when you're fetching a blog post title from an API. Here's how I do it now:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue'

const postTitle = ref('Loading...')
useHead({
  title: postTitle
})
onMounted(async () => {
  const data = await fetchPostData() 
  postTitle.value = data.title
})
</script>
```

This way, the title updates as soon as the data loads. It's not perfect, but it works pretty well for most cases.

## Title Templates

Title templates are pretty neat for keeping things consistent across your site. Nuxt uses some special placeholders:

- **%siteName**: Your site's name
- **%pageTitle**: The specific page title
- **%separator**: Separates parts of your title (I usually use a pipe &#124;)

Here's how I set it up in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    head: {
      titleTemplate: '%s %separator %siteName',
    }
  }
})
```

In this setup, `%s` is where your page title goes. It took me a while to get used to this syntax, but now I find it really handy.

### Tweaking Template Params

You can change these params globally or per-page. I often do this for special pages:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  title: 'My Awesome Blog Post',
  templateParams: {
    separator: '—',
    siteName: 'Cool Site'
  }
})
</script>
```

This uses a dash (—) instead of a pipe and changes the site name for this page. It's a small touch, but I think it makes certain pages stand out.


### Don't Forget Other Meta Tags

While we're talking about titles, don't forget about meta descriptions and Open Graph tags. They're important too:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  title: 'Home | MyApp',
  meta: [
    { name: 'description', content: 'Welcome to MyApp - where we make awesome happen' },
    { property: 'og:title', content: 'Home | MyApp' },
    { property: 'og:description', content: 'Check out MyApp today!' }
  ]
})
</script>
```

These help your content look good in search results and when shared on social media. I once forgot to set these up, and my social shares looked terrible for weeks!

### Auto Titles with Nuxt SEO Utils

Nuxt SEO Utils can generate titles based on the current path. It's pretty handy for dynamic routes like blog posts or product pages:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    head: {
      titleTemplate: '%s %separator %siteName',
    }
  }
})
```

With this setup, if someone hits `/about`, the title will be "About | MyApp" automatically. It's saved me a lot of time on larger projects.

### Default Titles

Setting up a default title is always a good idea. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    head: {
      titleTemplate: '%s %separator %siteName',
      templateParams: {
        siteName: 'MyApp'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

This way, even if you forget to set a specific title (and believe me, it happens), you'll still have "MyApp" as a fallback.

## Wrapping Up

Getting your page titles right in Nuxt isn't rocket science, but it does take some thought. I've found that a little effort here goes a long way in improving SEO and user experience. Don't be afraid to experiment and see what works best for your site. And remember, while these tools are great, nothing beats actually looking at your site in search results and tweaking things until they look just right.

Happy coding, and may your titles always be click-worthy!
