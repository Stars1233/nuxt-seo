## Introduction

Titles are the first thing we think about when optimizing our sites SEO. They are the main call-to-action in search results
and help the user understand what the page is about and where they are in relation to the site.

```html
<head>
  <title>Mastering Titles in Nuxt · Nuxt SEO<</title>
</head>
```

Setting page titles in Vue is straightforward, however, I've noticed that many developers still struggle
with setting them up in certain scenarios.

In this guide, I'll walk you through how I set up titles in Nuxt and some common pitfalls to avoid.

## Understanding the `<title>`{lang="html"} Tag

As a quick introduction, the `<title>`{lang="html"} tag tells the browser what to display in the tab or window title bar
 and hints search engines to show as the SERP (search engine result page) result.

It's recommended to keep the title under 60 characters, unique and descriptive of the page content. We mention that we're
hinting search engines to use this as the title, as they may choose to display a different title based on the search query.

You can learn more about this and title best practices on Google's [Influencing your title links in search results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link) guide.

## Understanding `useHead()`{lang="ts"}

If you use Nuxt or turn Vue 3, then you'll likely already be using my head manager library [Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/).

Unhead exposes a composable called [`useHead()`{lang="ts"}](https://unhead.unjs.io/) which you can use to set your page title as well as any other head tags.

Using this composable to set the page title is as simple as:

::code-group

```vue twoslash [input.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  title: 'Home'
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home</title>
</head>
```

::

## Reactivity with `useHead()`{lang="ts"}

As we're using Vue, we may be dealing with dynamic data that contains the page title, meaning we can only set
the title once the data has been fetched.

[Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/) has first-party Vue support, supporting any input as a ref, reactive or computed value.

A red flag you may come across in your code is if you find yourself destructing reactive data before passing it to `useHead()`{lang="ts}.

```ts twoslash
useHead({
  title: myTitle.value // ❌ Avoid destructuring reactive data
})
```

Instead, pass the reactive data directly to `useHead()`{lang="ts} to ensure it's reactive.

```ts twoslash
useHead({
  title: myTitle // ✅ Pass in reactive data, don't destruct it
})
```

This is important when we may have data that gets refreshed or updated, such as a blog post title or user profile name.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data } = await useAsyncData(() => fetchPostData())
const title = computed(() => data.value?.title)
useHead({
  title,
})
</script>
```

### SEO Concerns

It's important that we have a page title available in the SSR response, otherwise search engines may not honor the title.

::code-group

```vue [input.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const postTitle = ref('Loading...')
useHead({
  title: postTitle
})
// ❌ Avoid fetching data onMounted, it won't be available in SSR
onMounted(async () => {
  const data = await fetchPostData()
  postTitle.value = data.title
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Loading...</title>
</head>
```

::

## Title Templates

You may notice that most people set up their titles with a site name and a separator, this is seen as a best practice as it
can help with brand recognition and SEO.

```html
<head>
  <title>Home | MySite</title>
</head>
```

Creating your own title like this is simple using `useHead()`{lang="ts"} with a [Title Template](https://unhead.unjs.io/usage/guides/title-template).

::code-group

```vue twoslash [input.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  titleTemplate: '%s %seperator MySite'
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home | MySite</title>
</head>
```

::

You may notice these special `%s` tokens, which are frankly a bit weird. These are called [Template Params](https://unhead.unjs.io/usage/guides/template-params) and are replaced with the page title and separator respectively.

### Template Params

You may ask why we don't just use a function for the title template, and while this is supported, it can create issues with SSR and hydration.

Instead, it's recommended to use the params. Out-of-the-box, Unhead provides:

| Token | Description                                     |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `%s` | The current page title.                         |
| `%seperator` | The separator, defaults to a pipe character \|. |

You can add your own template params by passing them to `useHead()`{lang="ts"}.

::code-group

```vue twoslash [input.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  titleTemplate: '%s %seperator %siteName',
  templateParams: {
    seperator: '—',
    siteName: 'MySite'
  }
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home — MySite</title>
</head>
```

::

As we'll likely only ever have one root title template, you can set this globally in your `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    head: {
      titleTemplate: '%s %separator %siteName',
    }
  }
})
```

I'd suggest choosing your own separator as the `'|'` is a bit ugly in my opinion, you can try:

```ts
type Seperator = '-' | '—' | '•' | '·' | '❤️'
```

You can use template params in other head tags too, such as meta descriptions and open graph tags.

```ts
useHead({
  templateParams: {
    siteName: 'MyApp'
  },
  title: 'Home',
  meta: [
    { name: 'description', content: 'Welcome to %siteName - where we make awesome happen' },
    { property: 'og:title', content: 'Home | %siteName' },
    { property: 'og:description', content: 'Check out %siteName today!' }
  ]
})
```

### Resetting the Title Template

If you need to reset the title template for a specific page, you can pass `null` to the `titleTemplate` option.

::code-group

```vue [input.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  titleTemplate: null
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home</title>
</head>
```

::

### Social Share Titles

Now that we have the browser and SERP titles sorted, we should also consider social share titles.

:FigureImage{src="/nuxt-x-share.png" alt="Nuxt X Share" lazy="true"}

In the above we can see the title "Nuxt: The Intuitive Vue Framework".

This title is set using the `twitter:title` meta tag and will fall back to the `og:title` meta tag if not set.

Remembering how to use the meta tags can be annoying, so we can use the [`useSeoMeta()`{lang="ts"}](https://unhead.unjs.io/usage/composables/use-seo-meta) composable to set these up.

::code-group

```vue [input.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useSeoMeta({
  titleTemplate: '%s %seperator Health Tips',
  title: 'Why you should eat more broccoli',
  // og title is not effected by titleTemplate, we can use template params here if we need
  ogTitle: 'Hey! Health Tips %seperator 10 reasons to eat more broccoli.',
  // explicit twitter title is only needed when we want to display something just for X
  twitterTitle: 'Hey X! Health Tips %seperator 10 reasons to eat more broccoli.',
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Why you should eat more broccoli | Health Tips</title>
  <meta property="og:title" content="Health Tips: 10 reasons to eat more broccoli." />
  <meta name="twitter:title" content="Hey X! Health Tips - 10 reasons to eat more broccoli." />
</head>
```

::

## My Recommendations

1. Set your title template in your nuxt.config.

This will reduce your client-side bundle as the title template will be set globally.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    head: {
      titleTemplate: '%s %separator %siteName',
      templateParams: {
        seperator: '—', // choose a seperator
        siteName: 'MyApp' // set a site name
      }
    }
  }
})
```

2. Always pass in reactive data to `useHead()`{lang="ts"}

Makes sure our page titles are always reactive, I'd personally recommend using computed getter syntax which is the VueUse way.

```ts
const title = ref('Loading...')

useHead({
  // computed getter syntax
  title: () => `${title.value} - hold up!`
})
```

3. `useSeoMeta()`{lang="ts"} over `useHead()`{lang="ts"} for SEO meta tags.

```ts
useSeoMeta({
  title: 'Home',
  description: 'Welcome to MyApp',
  ogTitle: 'Home | MyApp',
  ogDescription: 'Welcome to MyApp',
})
```

4. Make life easier with template params

One of my favourite ways of using template params is to make sure we always have an `og:title` set. This can be done
globally with one line of code.

```ts
// will always use the page title
useSeoMeta({ ogTitle: '%s' })
```

5. Use Nuxt SEO Utils.

If you're not using Nuxt or you're not using the Nuxt SEO Utils module, then you're adding a lot of extra work for yourself.

## Nuxt SEO Utils

Nuxt SEO Utils is a powerful module that helps you manage your technical SEO. If you're using the Nuxt SEO module
it's already included for you.

It has a number of features that can help you manage your titles, such as:

### Fallback Titles

Usually we map our routes in a way that the page title and be inferred. For example, consider we have a route called `/about-us`,
it seems reasonable that we'd have a title of "About Us".

With Nuxt SEO Utils, this will in fact be the default behavior. If you don't set a title, it will use the last slug segment as the title.

You can read more about it in the [Enahcned Title](/docs/seo-utils/guides/fallback-title) guide.

### Automatic Social Share Titles

Most of the time our `<title>`{lang="html"} and our `<meta property="og:title">`{lang="html"} will be the same.

It's easy to forget to set the `og:title` meta tag, so Nuxt SEO Utils will automatically set this for you based on the page title, it will even
ignore the title template.

::code-group

```vue [input.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
useSeoMeta({
  titleTemplate: '%s %seperator Health Tips',
  title: 'Home',
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home | Health Tips</title>
  <meta property="og:title" content="Home" />
</head>
```
